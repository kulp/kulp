My name is **Darren Kulp**.  
For work, I build embedded software for systems that must not fail.  
For play, I build software that teaches me something new.

I have written:
- **C** code for an underground platform, and **C++** code for a stratospheric one
- **audio processing code** for a chip with less than a kilobyte of RAM, and **linear algebra kernels** for a supercomputer with a trillion times as much
- **real-time** code for processing radar signals, and **offline** code for translating JVM bytecode

I believe that:
- complex computing systems introduce creeping fragility into everyday life
- history will judge harshly our reckless use of unsafe programming languages
- the most important question we can ever ask is “how much will be too much?”

The projects I publish, I wrote to teach myself something.  
Making them public gives me reason to be rigorous and tidy.  
The greatest compliment for me is to see them built upon.
